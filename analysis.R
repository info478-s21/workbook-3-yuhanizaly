# Create the `charts/` directory (you can do this from R!)

# Load prepped data

# Are HALE and life expectancy correlated?
# - Plot 2016 life expectancy against 2016 HALE. Save the graph to `charts/`
# - Compute the correlation between 2016 life expectancy against 2016 HALE

# Are HALE and DALYs correlated?
# - Plot 2016 HALE against 2016 DALYs. Save the graph to `charts/`
# - Compute the correlation between 2016 HALE and DALYs


# As people live longer, do they live healthier lives 
# (i.e., is a smaller fraction of life spent in poor health)?
# Follow the steps below to attempt to answer this question.

# First, you will need to reshape the data to create columns *by metric-year*
# This will create `hale_2016`, `hale_1990`, `le_2016`, etc.
# To do this, I suggest that you use the `pivot` function in the new
# tidyverse release:https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html#wider


# Create columns to store the change in life expectancy, and change in hale


# Plot the *change in hale* against the *change in life expectancy*
# Add a 45 degree line (i.e., where x = y), and save the graph to `charts/`
# What does this mean?!?! Put your interpretation below
